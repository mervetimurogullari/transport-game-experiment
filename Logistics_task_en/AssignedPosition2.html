            About two weeks ago, you completed a questionnaire in which you were asked how you prefer to allocate resources 
            between yourself and others. The image below shows your result.
        </p>

        <img src="data:image/png;base64,{{ player.gauge_plot_svo }}" />

        <h4>Who are you negotiating with?</h4>

        <p>
            The other participants also completed the same questionnaire. Their results are shown below.        
        </p>

        <p>
            {{ for other_player in player.get_others_in_group }}
                Company <strong>{{ other_player.position }}</strong> transports <strong>{{other_player.resources}}</strong> tons. 
                Their result is displayed below.<br>

                <img src="data:image/png;base64,{{ other_player.gauge_plot_svo }}" /><br>

            {{ endfor }}

            Note that every participant will see these scores for all three players in the negotiation.
