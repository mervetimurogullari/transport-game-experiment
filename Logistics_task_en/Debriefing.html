    Dear participant, you have finished the study. Thank you very much for your participation!
</p>

<p>
    You participated in the Transport Game, which simulates how coalitions between transport companies are formed.
    With this study, we aim to investigate <strong>how visible information about other participants’ preferences 
    (regarding the distribution of resources between oneself and others) influences trust and decision-making in negotiations 
    about coalition. In psychological research, this preference is referred to as Social Value Orientation.
</p>

<p>
    This study consisted of two groups. You were randomly assigned in advance to either the experimental group or the control group.
    Some people primarily focus on their own benefit, while others place more emphasis on what is best for everyone (social value orientation).
    Depending on your group assignment, <strong>you saw every player’s social value orientation score throughout the negotiation 
    (experimental group)</strong> or <strong>this information was not visible to you throughout the negotiation (control group)</strong>. 
    This allows us to examine how having or not having this information affects coalition formation and negotiation strategies.</p>

<p>
    If you are interested in the results of this experiment, please let us know, and we will provide you with a summary of the 
    results of our study once available. Should you have any questions about the study or its procedures, please contact 
    the principal investigator, Merve Timuroğulları at <a href="mailto:m.timurogullari@tilburguniversity.edu">here</a>.
