        <p><strong>Study on coalitions</strong></p>

        <p>
            This study is conducted by the Tilburg School of Social and Behavioral Sciences and the Tilburg School of Economics 
            and Management of Tilburg University. We are interested in how people form coalitions and how make decisions about 
            themselves and others. In this study, you will take the role of a transportation company, negotiating with two other 
            participants, representing other companies, to divide a sum of money. 
            {{ if incentives }} 
            The money earned in the game will be converted into a real monetary bonus at the end of the experiment.
            {{ endif }}
        </p>

            <strong>Important:</strong> In this study, three participants will engage in a live negotiation process. 
            For this reason, the interactive elements of the negotiation are timed. 
            Each page should be completed within 5 minutes, which is more than enough time. 
            A timer will be displayed on all pages to which this applies. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong class="text-danger">
                If, during the negotiation phase of the study, you cannot complete any page within {{ timeout_time_minutes }} minutes, 
                the study will automatically be terminated for all participants.
                {{ if incentives }}
                If this happens, none of the participants will be able to obtain any bonus payment.
                {{ endif }}
                Thus, make sure that you have enough time to complete the study if you participate.

        <p><strong>Duration and payment</strong></p>

        <p>
            This study will take about 20 minutes. You will receive a base fee of 5.00 Euros as compensation. 
            As a participant, you will answer questions throughout the negotiation process, to understand how you make decisions. 
            Sometimes, we ask the same questions again to understand possible changes in the negotiation. 
            Note that during this study, <strong>you will interact live with two other participants</strong>. 
            This means that you sometimes must wait for a while, for example, when you are being matched with other participants 
            or when other participants are considering their next action. This waiting time is included in the study duration 20 
            minutes. Because the negotiations can differ in how long they take, there is some variation in how long it 
            takes to finish the study. Depending on the outcome of the negotiation, the money that you earned during the 
            study will be converted into a real monetary bonus that you receive in addition to the base fee of between 
            0 and 5.00 euros.
