        To recap, a bonus of 9000 euros is available for companies that form a coalition to use the larger truck together. 
        Here, we explain in detail which coalitions can be formed. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Irrespective of which of the following coalitions is formed, members of the coalition then must decide how to 
        split the 9000 euros. Those not included in a formed coalition will have to use their company’s own truck and 
        will receive no bonus.
