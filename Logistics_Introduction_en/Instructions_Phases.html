    <p>
        Negotiations take place over several rounds, until an agreement is reached. 
        The negotiation follows a set pattern of phases in each negotiation round:
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Phase I: Making proposals</strong><br>
        You start by making a proposal which includes:
        <ul>
            <li>Your choice of coalition (you must be a part of the coalition you propose).</li> 
            <li>How the 9000 euros bonus are divided in your proposed coalition.</li> 
        </ul>
        All other participants also make their own proposal.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Phase II: Choosing proposals</strong><br>
        You will see all proposals: your own proposal and the two proposals from the other participants. 
        Out of these, you choose one proposal. You can only choose a proposal which needs to include you. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The other participants also choose a proposal.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Phase III: Coalition results</strong><br>
        You will see whether a coalition has been formed. A coalition is formed if two or three participants 
        choose the same proposal in Phase II. For a two-company coalition, two players must select the same proposal; 
        for a three-company coalition, three players must select the same proposal. 
    </p>

    <p>
        If a coalition is formed, the bonus of 9000 euros is then distributed accordingly. 
        If no proposal is accepted by all the companies involved, then no coalition is formed, and negotiations go 
        on with a new round of proposals. The negotiation will continue until a successful coalition is formed. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
        If no coalition has been formed after 20 rounds, this part of the study ends without a coalition and no bonus will be paid.
