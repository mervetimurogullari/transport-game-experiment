        This study consists of three parts.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Part 1:</strong> A step-by-step explanation of this study. 
        {{ if timers }}
        Each page in this section has a {{ timeout_time_minutes }}-minute limit.
        {{ endif }}
        Please read everything carefully to fully understand the study.
        {{ if comprehension_check }}
        At the end, we will ask you a few questions to check whether everything is clear.
        {{ endif }}
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Part 2:</strong> You are matched with two other participants for the actual negotiation. 
        {{ if timers }}
        Each page also has a {{ timeout_time_minutes }}-minute time limit, but feel free to respond quicker if possible. 
        This helps keeping the negotiation moving without long waits. 
        {{ endif }}
        {{ if incentives }}
        Remember that the outcome of the negotiation can earn you money. The better your negotiation outcomes, the more you earn. 
        {{ endif }}
        During the negotiation you will answer questions about how you view your negotiation partners.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Part 3:</strong> This section involves personal and study-related questions. 
        {{ if timers }}
        There is no time limit here because you are no longer negotiating with others. 
        {{ endif }}
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Important note: To capture changes in your views and the negotiation dynamics, please expect to see similar 
        questions repeated throughout all three parts of the study.</strong>
