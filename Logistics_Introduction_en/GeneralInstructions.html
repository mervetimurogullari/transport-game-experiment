    The negotiation situation

    <p>
        In the transport sector, companies can often save money (and reduce CO₂ emissions) by collaborating in the transport 
        of cargo. However, such collaboration requires negotiation between companies on who will collaborate with who and on 
        how to divide the earnings of the collaboration. We study such negotiations in this experiment.
    </p> 
    
    </p>
        You and two other participants each represent a different transport company. The three companies transport a total of 
        9 tons of cargo each day from Amsterdam to Paris. Each company uses a truck sized to its own freight needs.
    </p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Company A:</strong> The market leader, transporting 4 tons of cargo every day.</li> 
            <img src="{{ static 'global/images/company_a.png' }}" style="height: 1.66cm; width: 5.95cm;">

            <li><strong>Company B:</strong> A medium-sized company, transporting 3 tons of cargo every day.</li>
            <img src="{{ static 'global/images/company_b.png' }}" style="height: 1.69cm; width: 4.95cm;">

            <li><strong>Company C:</strong> A smaller company, transporting 2 tons of cargo every day.</li>
            <img src="{{ static 'global/images/company_c.png' }}" style="height: 1.68cm; width: 3.95cm;">
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        A larger truck is available that can carry up to 9 tons. This truck, however, is only allowed on the road if it carries 
        at least 5 tons. This means that none of the companies individually have enough cargo to use this larger truck, 
        they need to form a coalition to do so.  
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>A very attractive proposal has arisen.</strong> There is a company in Paris that offers a 9000-euro premium if 
        the large truck is brought to Paris. This makes a coalition among companies to share the large truck more attractive.  
        Any combination of companies carrying at least 5 tons of freight can use the large truck and thus claim the premium 
        of 9000 euros. The figure below  summarizes the negotiation situation.

        The questions are:
        <ol type="1">
            <li> Which companies will collaborate?</li>
            <li> How will the 9000 euros bonus be distributed?</li>
        </ol>
