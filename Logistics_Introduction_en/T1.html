    <p>
        Before we proceed with the explanation, we would like to know what you expect from <strong>the two other participants who 
        will join you in the negotiation process</strong>. 
        
        Remember, these are two other people from the LISS panel, who have seen exactly the same explanation as you just have. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Please indicate for each of the statements below to what extent you agree or disagree that they describe the other 
        participants. What do you expect from these participants?
    </p>

        Note: If you are using a phone, we recommend holding it horizontally for a better view.
